How to run with docker
===
Clone the repository and enter the sql-injection-101 dictionary. To start the server containing the presentation and the target run "docker-compose up". You now can access the content at http://localhost:8080.

If another service on your machine already uses port 8080, you can change it in the file "docker-compose.yml"
